# BinaryTree_Checker

Prompts the user to input values for a binary tree, prints an indented representation of the tree, and determines whether the tree is:

- a **Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- an **Unbalanced BST**
- or **not a BST**  

---

## Overview

This project is a Java tool that allows users to build a binary tree via input values, visualize its structure with indentation, and analyze its properties:

- Checks if the tree is a **Binary Search Tree** (i.e. left < root < right throughout)  
- Checks if it is **balanced** (i.e. the depths of the two sub‑trees of every node differ by at most one)  
- Reports accordingly: *Balanced BST*, *Unbalanced BST*, or *Not a BST*  

---

## Features

- Build tree from user‑entered values  
- Indented printout of the tree structure to show parent / child relationships  
- BST validation logic  
- Balance checking logic  
- Clear output to indicate which of the three categories the given tree falls into

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher 
- A terminal/console for running the program  
- An IDE or text editor (optional, for viewing and editing)
